Collection of personal Astronomy projects

Tess Data Personal Project: This project is a Light Curve Visualization with the goal of classifying the transits associated to them. In this project public TESS light curve datga from the Mikulski archive was used with several imports such as astronpy, matplot, lombscargle, etc...
The objective of this project was to characterize patterns in the flux data and sort the files into different lists depending on their tendencies.
This turned out to be fairly challenging to do as the public TESS data had to be recalibrated at several points leaving blank areas in the resulting data. This can be seen in the visualizaitons of the light curves.
